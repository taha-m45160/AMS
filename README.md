# Academics Management System (AMS)
AMS is a web-based portal which aims to remove the use of Whatsapp and Facebook as
official modes of communication between students, teachers and parents due to the online mode of
education. It achieves this by providing an easy to use interface for all the users including
parents who can monitor the academic standings of their children in a more systematic way. This
will remove the hassle of juggling through texts and posts on social media platforms for all the
intended users because of the availability of all relevant resources and deadlines in one platform.
For teachers, it also provides the feature of conducting quizzes online in addition to uploading
resources and assignments, which in these uncertain times of hybrid education is going to ensure
that weekly/monthly assessments of students face no delay.
